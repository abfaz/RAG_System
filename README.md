# Build a RAG System on “Leave No Context Behind” Paper

## Introduction
This README provides an overview of a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built using the LangChain framework. The system leverages the power of the Gemini 1.5 Pro Language Model to answer questions on the "Leave No Context Behind" paper published by Google on 10th April 2024.

## Background
Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini often lack access to company-specific information or recent updates. However, valuable data may exist in various formats such as PDFs, Text Files, etc. Integrating these external sources with LLMs can significantly enhance their capabilities.

## System Overview
The LangChain RAG system integrates external data sources, such as the "Leave No Context Behind" paper, with the Gemini 1.5 Pro Language Model. It follows the Retrieval-Augmented Generation paradigm, where relevant passages are retrieved from the external source and then utilized during the generation step by the LLM.

## Components:
1. **Retrieval Module**: Responsible for retrieving relevant passages from the external data source (e.g., "Leave No Context Behind" paper).

2. **LangChain Framework**: Provides the infrastructure for integrating external data and LLMs, facilitating seamless communication and interaction between different components.

3. **Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM**: The core language model used for generating responses to user queries. Gemini 1.5 Pro is a powerful LLM developed by OpenAI.

4. **Question-Answering Pipeline**: Manages the flow of information, from receiving user questions to generating responses. It orchestrates the interaction between the retrieval module and Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM.

## Usage

To use the LangChain RAG system for answering questions on the "Leave No Context Behind" paper, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Ensure that the LangChain framework and Gemini 1.5 Pro are properly installed and configured.

2. **nput Question**: Provide a question related to the content of the "Leave No Context Behind" paper.

3. **Retrieval**: The system will retrieve relevant passages from the paper using the retrieval module.

4. **Generation**: Utilizing the retrieved passages, Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM will generate a coherent and contextually relevant response to the question.

5. **Output**: The generated response will be presented to the user, providing insights and information derived from the "Leave No Context Behind" paper.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with Diverse Data Sources**: Extend the system to integrate with various data sources beyond PDFs and Text Files, such as databases, APIs, and online repositories.

2. **Enhanced Retrieval Mechanisms**: Implement advanced retrieval mechanisms, including semantic search and entity recognition, to improve the relevance and accuracy of retrieved passages.

3. **Dynamic Context Integration**: Develop mechanisms to dynamically integrate context from retrieved passages into the generation process, ensuring more accurate and coherent responses.
